# Sprites
I'm releasing custom sprites and codehacks I've made here.

If you want to add it to your own project, I'm going to assume you know *how* to; there will be no guide here.

## NSMBW
These were made with NewerSMBW in mind, with 1.30 headers.

## NSMBU
These were made with Tsuru in mind, made for my (now cancelled) NSMBU hack; "Super Mario Sunset".

There are currently no plains to add these to the [main Tsuru repo](https://github.com/Zenith-Team/Tsuru). Please don't try to do it yourself, either.

### Resources
These were pulled from old versions from when I was working on them, so they may or may not work.
